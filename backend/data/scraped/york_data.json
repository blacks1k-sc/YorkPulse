As an undergraduate student, your course fee structure is based on: - your assignedfees cohort year - the designation of youracademicprogram major(s)asprofessionalorregular - whether your fees are charged by number of course credits (course-based fees) or by time periods of enrolment (program-based fees) - whether you qualify fordomestic tuition You are assigned a fees cohort year when you enter a program at York. In most cases, it is based on the year that you entered the University and completed at least one course in your current program. If you transferred here from another university, your fees cohort year is based on when we admitted you, not on when your previous university admitted you. For example, if you are admitted and complete at least one course in Summer 2022 or Fall/Winter 2022-2023 you are assigned the2022fees cohort year. ##### Can my Fees Cohort Year Change? Your fees cohort year will change if: - you do not complete a course in the academic year (September-August) you are first admitted to your program. Your fees cohort will change if you are readmitted to York or allowed to defer your admission to the following year. - you do not complete at least one course at York University over a total of two consecutive academic years — that is, any four or more consecutive summer and fall/winter sessions — and therefore need to re-activate your academic record. - You complete your undergraduate program and start a new program.

To do so, you must re-activate your record because you have not completed any courses at York in the previous four consecutive academic sessions. Because you re-activated for Summer 2023, you are re-assigned to the2023fees cohort year. Undergraduate program majors not listed below are designatedregular.

York University acknowledges its presence on the traditional territory of many Indigenous Nations. The area known as Tkaronto [Tig-ar-on-toe] has been care taken by the Anishinabek [Nish-na-bek] Nation, the Haudenosaunee [Ho-dee-no-sho-nee] Confederacy, and the Huron-Wendat. It is now home to many First Nation, Inuit and Métis communities. We acknowledge the current treaty holders, the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation. This territory is subject of the Dish with One Spoon Wampum Belt Covenant, an agreement to peaceably share and care for the Great Lakes region. ## Connect with York University Libraries - Facebook - Twitter - Instagram - YouTube",

You can accept your offer through MyFile or OUAC app and get ready for an exciting new adventure! - You can also accept an offer to another program and continue to apply to employment positions – if you do happen to land a job, we will help you switch back to Digital Technologies. ### ACCEPT YOUR OFFER MAY – AUGUST 2026 Imagine earning a full-time salary while spending approximately 20% of your working time released to study for aBachelor of Applied Science in Digital Technologies (BASc)degree. 80% of the program is experiential, starting from day one, so your theoretical and academic learning can be immediately applied on the job. In addition to having access to York University’s student services, you’ll have both aProfessional Skills Coachand aCourse Director, as well as aHiring Manager (Mentor)who will support you and help develop your skills in the workplace. Check out ourpress release about the programto learn more. ## Finishing high school and have limited job and/or computer experience? That’s ok! If you’re a Creative who enjoys TikTok challenges, DIY and life hacks, this could be the degree program for you. Your creative hobbies show an aptitude for STEM that could take you far in the field. By becoming a ‘Creator’ at Lassonde, you can build change from the ground up and turn seemingly abstract ideas into realities that contribute to a more just, sustainable world. You’ll join a caring, diverse community of creators, many of whom have been traditionally underrepresented in STEM. ## Looking to reskill or upskill? Open to a career change or advancement? There’s no shortage of lucrative opportunities in the fast-paced Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector. It’s never too late to build on your education, and through the Integrated Program, you can earn while you learn. Meaning, you don’t need to forgo a salary to get ahead. While you pursue an internationally recognized quality-assured degree qualification, your employer will also benefit from your access to the latest expertise, knowledge and resources that a university can provide. It’s a win-win! The design and development of York’s Digital Technologies degree program was a collaborative process between Lassonde and a visionary group of businesses, companies, public sector organizations, and industry associations known as “Trailblazers.” We’ve engaged with senior technology experts at these organizations to ensure the program delivers the knowledge, skills and behaviours you need to succeed as a highly competent expert in software development, cyber security or data science: ## Our Trailblazers, representing various sectors and sizes, include: Ceridian, CGI, Cinchy Inc., Cisco Canada, Connected (Connected.io, Now part of Thoughtworks), EY Canada, General Motors of Canada Company, IBM Canada, mimik Technology Inc., RBC, Saa Dene Group, Shopify Inc., TELUS Health, Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat and TribalScale Inc. ## A successful model in the UK Although this is new to Canada, this model is highly successful in the UK. The first tranche of the UK programs was rolled out in 2015 with 756 learners across the UK and has now grown to ~22,500 learners. The majority of higher education providers in England offer these types of programs. ## Frequently Asked Questions #### Watch Now!

In most cases, it is based on the year that you entered the University and completed at least one course in your current program. If you transferred here from another university, your fees cohort year is based on when we admitted you, not on when your previous university admitted you. For example, if you are admitted and complete at least one course in Summer 2022 or Fall/Winter 2022-2023 you are assigned the2022fees cohort year. ##### Can my Fees Cohort Year Change? Your fees cohort year will change if: - you do not complete a course in the academic year (September-August) you are first admitted to your program. Your fees cohort will change if you are readmitted to York or allowed to defer your admission to the following year. - you do not complete at least one course at York University over a total of two consecutive academic years — that is, any four or more consecutive summer and fall/winter sessions — and therefore need to re-activate your academic record. - You complete your undergraduate program and start a new program.
