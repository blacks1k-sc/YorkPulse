# route53.tf — DNS records for yorkpulse.com in the existing Route 53 hosted zone
#
# The hosted zone (Z01059542TIO3YH228MAS) was created via AWS CLI already.
# This file manages ALL DNS records for yorkpulse.com inside that zone.
#
# Record overview:
#   TLS          → ACM validation CNAME + certificate_validation resource
#   Email (send) → Brevo DKIM CNAMEs, Resend DKIM TXT, DMARC TXT, Brevo verify TXT
#   Email (recv) → send.yorkpulse.com MX + SPF TXT (SES bounce handling)
#   Trust        → CAA records for root + api subdomain
#   Frontend     → Vercel A + www CNAME (Vercel frontend stays live)
#   Backend      → api.yorkpulse.com A record (placeholder → updated to ALB after apply)
#
# IMPORTANT: After terraform apply, update nameservers at your registrar (Name.com)
# to the four Route 53 nameservers in the route53_nameservers output.
